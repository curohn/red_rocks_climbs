RED ROCKS SCENIC LOOP - CLIMBING AREA ANALYSIS
===============================================

OVERVIEW:
=========
This analysis processes 1,000 climbing routes from Mountain Project data to:
1. Determine the order of climbing areas along the Red Rocks Scenic Loop Drive
2. Score areas based on climbing preferences for 5.7-5.10 grade climbers
3. Categorize routes by type (trad vs sport) and difficulty grades
4. Provide comprehensive area summaries for trip planning

METHODOLOGY:
============
- Uses polar coordinate system centered at (36.12, -115.47) 
- Calculates angular positions to sequence areas along the one-way scenic loop
- 13-mile counter-clockwise drive starting from visitor center area
- Targets the main Red Rocks Scenic Loop Drive (one-way scenic route)

SCORING SYSTEM FOR AREA RANKING:
================================
Each route receives points based on climbing preferences:

BASE SCORING:
- Every climb: +1 point (base value)
- Average star rating: +1 point per star (0-4 stars)

DIFFICULTY BONUSES (tailored for 5.7-5.10 climbers):
- Routes 5.7-5.10: +2 points (sweet spot difficulty)
- Routes under 5.7: +1 point (warm-up/easy routes)
- Routes over 5.10: +0 points (too difficult for target grade)

ROUTE TYPE MODIFIERS:
- Sport routes: +1 point (bolt protection, easier logistics)
- Multi-pitch routes: -1 point (more time/complexity required)
- Traditional routes: +0 points (neutral, gear-dependent)

GRADE CATEGORIES:
================
Routes are categorized into difficulty bands:
- 5.0-5.6: Beginner routes
- 5.7-5.8: Intermediate (target sweet spot)
- 5.9-5.10: Advanced (target sweet spot)  
- 5.11: Expert level
- 5.12+: Very advanced
- Unknown: Missing or unclear grades
